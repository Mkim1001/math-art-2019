                        <p>This is a class about math and art.  It's my hope that some knowledge of math can expand your artistic practice and that some knowledge of art can expand your sense of what math is.</p>  
                        <p>On a very practical level, this course aims to give you familiarity with the tools that will make it easier to make technologically oriented art.  This class aims to get you comfortable with thinking mathematically, and will introduce you to mathematical ways of thinking that will make it a lot easier for you to make digital art of all kinds.  You'll learn to code in javascript or python and more importantly will learn to think programmatically.  You'll learn the math behind pixels and sound and electronics.  You'll learn to think algorithmically and understand how to successfully hack together whatever it is you want to do using readily available open source tools.</p>
                        <p>We'll also look at ways that math is actually a lot like art, art that is inspired by math, and make a whole lot of trippy visualizations.  The goal, as always, is to have fun and learn a lot along the way.  </p>

<!-- <p>This course we will explore some of the many ways which artists have used games, and fun, to extend and challenge themselves and their audiences.</p>
                        <p>Along the way we will consider Dada and Surrealist and Fluxus and Minimalist and Situationist and Relational and Political and Nonsense and Language and all sorts of other games in all sorts of mediums.</p>
                        <p>You may produce your games in any medium.  Instead of games, you may produce blueprints or sketches of games or you may produce movies about or using games, or you may produce poems or music or performance.  You should be willing to serve as a performer or cast member or audience member for your classmates.</p>
                        <p>Our final project will actually be two projects: first, a game, of your design; and second, a gallery show of documentation of a performance or various performances of that game.  Students will be asked to present their final game projects on their scheduled critique days and then will all create a single gallery show together, on the last day of class, consisting of the documentation of those performances.  This documentation can be photgraphic, video, text, sculptural or...other!</p>
                        <p>In addition to your game projects, you will be expected to complete regular assignments using the techniques and technologies which will be introduced in class, which will include 3D modeling, compositing and a variety of tools for computer game design/building.  These projects (along with other things you thik are interesting!) should be posted to your tumblr blog for everyone to see.  You must sign up for tumblr and give me the link so I can ink to it from the course web site or you won't pass the class.</p>
                        <p>Some experience with writing code will be helpful, but not required.  If you have no experience with code but are interested to learn more please visit the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for a host of resources to help you along your way, and dont be afraid to ask.  You don't have to write any code in this class if you don't want to, games can be completed in all kinds of ways and all kinds of mediums.</p> -->
